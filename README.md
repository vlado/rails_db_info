# Rails database info [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vlado/rails_db_info.png)](https://travis-ci.org/vlado/rails_db_info) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/vlado/rails_db_info.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/vlado/rails_db_info)

Show database info in your Rails app by visiting `http://localhost:3000/rails/info/db`

**Demo** available at [http://rails-db-info-demo.herokuapp.com](http://rails-db-info-demo.herokuapp.com)

## Install

Add this to the development group in your Gemfile

```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'rails_db_info'
end
```

Run `bundle install`

Modify routes.rb

```ruby
  mount RailsDbInfo::Engine => "/rails/info/db"
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000/rails/info/db` and you will see your database schema and values.

## Why?

I was using [Annotate](https://github.com/ctran/annotate_models) to annotate my models with schema info. When I saw [Sextant](https://github.com/schneems/sextant) I got an idea to create something similar for database and the rest is history :)

## Todo / Ideas

- [ ] Improve CSS
- [ ] Add small bar (like miniprofiler has) at top of the page or add key listener(s). When triggered it would show database info. For example you are working on UsersController and when you press Cmd+D users table info slides down.
- [ ] Generator to copy assets in case asset pipeline is disabled

Contributions welcome :)
